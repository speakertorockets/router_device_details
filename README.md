# router_device_details

This dotnet console application scrapes the unsecured AT&T router webpage for details on the devices registered on the local network.  

This has been tested against the ATT provided Pace Plc router Model 5268AC, hardware version 260-2173300 and software version 11.14.1.533857-att.  This application scrapes the html from the web page using the AngleSharp library version 1.1.2.
